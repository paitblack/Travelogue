# 🌍✈️ Travelogue — Cherish Your Beautiful Memories

**Travelogue** is a personalized mobile travel journal designed to help users document their journeys, visualize their global footprint, and plan future adventures.

More than just a logbook, Travelogue acts as a **digital memory box**, allowing users to store photos, notes, and dates associated with their trips  whether it's a concert in another city or a vacation abroad.

With features like **“Where I've Been”** (an interactive map), **“Goal Travels”** (bucket list planning), and a nostalgic **“This Day Last Year”** reminder, the application ensures that no travel memory fades away.

Whether you are looking back at a concert in Antalya or counting down the seconds to your dream trip to Tokyo, **Travelogue keeps your travel history organized and accessible.**
